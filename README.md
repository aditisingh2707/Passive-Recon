# Passive Recon Burp Extension

Passive Recon is a **Burp Suite extension** that performs **all-in-one passive reconnaissance** while you browse or test a target.  
It automatically detects and collects **endpoints**, **subdomains**, **GraphQL queries (including meta-GraphQL)**, and **URLs** from every request/response.

## üîó Works Great with Wayback Recon
Use together with [Wayback Recon](https://github.com/aditisingh2707/Wayback-Recon) for maximum coverage:
1. Run **Wayback Recon** to fetch archived URLs from Wayback Machine
2. Send those URLs to Burp‚Äôs sitemap
3. **Passive Recon** will automatically scan them for:
   - Subdomains
   - Endpoints
   - GraphQL queries (including meta-GraphQL)
   - URLs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Some large responses may slow down parsing  
- May produce **false positives or noisy results**, depending on the target and response contents
